# My portfolio site
This site is designed to document some of my recent published work. The site is split into several sections:

## Work
Showcasing some recent standout projects.

## About me
A little background in case you're looking for some freelance help.

## Contact
If you are, let's get in contact! _(Note, I am not the Indianapolis Colts General Manager Chris Ballard, nor the Sports Illustrated sports writer. Though I do love sports and journalism!)_# portfolio-site
